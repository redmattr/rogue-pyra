// This file holds small, simple data objects (DTOs) that both the server and
// clients need to know about. Keeping these here avoids circular references
// and keeps networking files cleaner.
//
// In our project, the "Lobby" object is used by the TCP server to keep track
// of game lobbies (rooms) that players can create, list, and join.
